# Planck RAWHID

My personal project for playing around with RAWHID on my Planck keyboard. Ideally I'd like to fully "clone" the VIA keyboard suite, but also make it opensource as well. IIRC, VIA also communicates through HID. Even if it doesn't, I'm sure I can do it with HID.

## Installation

1) make sure your keymap in qmk has RAWHID enabled, with functions implemented (check QMK docs)
2) node-hid installed

```bash
npm install node-hid
```

## Usage
//TODO
